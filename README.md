# Julia Function Bug: Floating Point Precision and Type Stability

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Julia function that arises from floating-point precision limitations and type instability. The function `my_function` calculates the square of positive numbers and the negative of negative numbers. While it works correctly for smaller numbers, it produces unexpected results when dealing with very large negative numbers due to rounding errors inherent in floating-point arithmetic.

The bug also highlights how type stability can affect the results. Passing different numeric types as input can lead to variations in the output.

## Bug Description

The `my_function` function correctly computes x² for positive x and -x for negative x for smaller values.  However, for sufficiently large negative x, the calculation of x² results in a value slightly less than the true mathematical result, due to the limitations of floating point representation. This difference becomes significant with large magnitudes.

Furthermore, the return type of the function depends on the input type; this lack of type stability can lead to unexpected results or inefficiencies in larger applications.

## Solution

The solution involves careful consideration of the numeric types used and potential workarounds for floating-point inaccuracies.  The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a refined version of the function that addresses the issues, ensuring more accurate and stable results across various input types and magnitudes.
